# metamorphic testing

The examples are heuristics. These are generic Metamorphic Relations that might need adjustments to fit the specific context of your application. 
CSV format:

"Metamorphic Relation (MR)","Source Input","Initial Output","Transformation of the input","Output Check"

Remember that the "Initial Output" column is hypothetical and represents what the typical output might be based on the "Source Input", but in real applications, the actual output might vary based on various factors and the current state of the system. This format clearly differentiates the initial operation (source input), its expected outcome (initial output), the modified operation (transformation of the input), and the final expected outcome (output check). Adjust the "Initial Output" as necessary to be specific to the system being tested.
